```python
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
```

## Install Python and JupyterLab

[Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.

Alternatively, install JupyterLab with `pip3 install jupyterlab`.

## Create or upload a Jupyter notebook

Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting `<MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>` and `<SHORT-POST-TITLE>` with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:

```bash
mkdir -p <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
cd <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
jupyter lab kernel9d08eb2216.ipynb
```

The `jupyter` command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.

## Edit your post metadata

The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata ([front matter](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/)).

In Jupter, choose _Markdown_ as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:

```

## Convert notebook to Markdown

```bash
jupyter nbconvert kernel9d08eb2216.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.
```
