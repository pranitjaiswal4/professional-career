## Install Python and JupyterLab

[Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.

Alternatively, install JupyterLab with `pip3 install jupyterlab`.

## Create or upload a Jupyter notebook

Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting `<MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>` and `<SHORT-POST-TITLE>` with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:

```bash
mkdir -p <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
cd <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
jupyter lab kernel9d08eb2216.ipynb
```

The `jupyter` command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.

## Edit your post metadata

The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata ([front matter](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/)).

In Jupter, choose _Markdown_ as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:

```

## Convert notebook to Markdown

```bash
jupyter nbconvert kernel9d08eb2216.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.
```
