### Summary:
• This Project is based on a Kaggle Competition on Classifiers in data mining ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started ).   

• Created a jupyter notebook (using python) to refine given data and conclude results.   

• Predicted which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.   

• The purpose is of this notebook to submit my project of Data Mining to practice classifier and feature engineering.
